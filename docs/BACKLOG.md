## Scoring system for multi-dart routines e.g. Checkouts, not working

Game should behave like this:

OPP display target checkout value
OPP prompts player to input visit score
Player selects the darts thrown
OPP calculates the outcome. one of:
- Player checkouts in 1,2,3 darts
- Player scores, but still has outstanding target. Player throws again
- Player busts. Player throws again.
After 3 visits (9 darts), OPP moves player to next routine step




## ~~Session display. Display completed sessions. Add a status column, with the values: Completed, Due, Future~~ (Done: play screen shows all sessions with Status and Score.)

## Admin Portal 

Need capability to clear a user session.

Add a feature flag for BR. Either 0, or set to ITA


From these views, we should be able to drill down:

/admin/cohorts > players > sessions > routines > scores

/admin/players > sessions > routines > scores

## Dark mode

add a dark mode and make it choosable from user profile


## Password Show toggle

give users the option to see the password as they enter it
