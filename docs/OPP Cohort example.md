On competition days, players will play all 5 legs, regardless of outcome. Their performance will be used to determine a player's MR

During the course, 2 leaderboards will be maintained. A Training leaderboard (showing TR delta) and a Match Leaderboard (showing match performance. actual vs expected)

Finals night will consist of 2 groups of 4. Round Robin format. First to 6 legs, There will be a handicap system in place.

Semi-finals will be first to 6 legs, handicap still in place. Final will be first to 6 legs, no handicap.
