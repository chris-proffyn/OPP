# SINGLE PLAYER TRAINING

We need a user flow for the solo player who wants to train, but doesn't want to join a training cohort.

user journey should be as follows:

When user clicks Play..

System shows their scheduled/completed sessions. Once the player has completed their ITA, this will just show the ITA entry.

Add a button that says 'Generate Solo Training Schedule'

When the user clicks on this, OPP will display a list of schedules for the player to select from. When the player selects a schedule, OPP will ask for confirmation and a start date.

OPP will create a cohort, especially for that player, using the following information

Cohort name: Composite of Player Nickname || solo cohort
Level: Taken from user profile
Start date: Taken from user input
Schedule: Taken from user input.

OPP will then create the other elements to allow the player to follow that training schedule.
