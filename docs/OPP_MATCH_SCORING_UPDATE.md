# Match_darts_scores

We also need a table to record player throws during matches. Every throw must be recorded. Data to be kept. match_id (see matches table). Starting score, dart_score, remaining_total.

We should also use this table for player practice matches (which could be solo play). In this case, the match_id will be a dummy one (or a dummy record in the matches table to denote solo match practice)
