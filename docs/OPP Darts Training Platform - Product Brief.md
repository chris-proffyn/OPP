OPP Darts Training Platform
Community-Led Training. Structured Improvement. Earned Progress.

# Purpose of This Document

This document outlines the vision, structure, and differentiators of the OPP Darts Training Platform, with particular emphasis on the community and culture that underpin its long-term success. All thoughts and ideas are just suggestions at this stage.

# 1. The Core Idea

OPP is a community-led darts training platform built around structured improvement, shared standards, and measurable progress. It exists to give players a place they belong, a clear path to improvement, a fair way to measure themselves, and a community that values effort over ego. This is not a solo training app. It is a club you join.

## Realised by:

* A socially active community presence (e.g. Facebook Groups, Instagram, X) where members can:
  + Share ideas and experiences
  + Discuss progress and challenges
  + Support one another’s development
* Regular supporting content (e.g. a dedicated YouTube channel) providing:
  + Instructional videos
  + Training philosophy explanations
  + Community stories and progress spotlights
* A feature-rich platform that:
  + Delivers tailored, structured, time-sensitive training
  + Records performance consistently
  + Adapts training based on progress and assessments
* Explicit framing of the platform as a shared journey, not a solo tool

# 2. The Real Problem Being Solved

Most darts players are not short of apps or games. What they lack is structure, accountability, consistency, and a trusted peer group. Players often practice alone, guess what to work on, and judge progress in isolation. OPP makes improvement social, visible, and shared.

## **Realised by:**

* Structured training plans with clear objectives rather than open-ended play
* Guided sessions that explain what to train and why
* Progress tracking that focuses on trends and development, not just raw averages
* Community visibility that normalises effort, plateaus, and gradual improvement

# 3. Community as the Foundation

Community is not layered on top of OPP. It is the engine. Players train together, share progress, and uphold standards collectively. This sense of belonging drives motivation, accountability, and long-term engagement.

## **Realised by:**

* Access to visible training cohorts and programme-based groups
* Community challenges and shared milestones
* Public recognition for consistency and improvement
* Social reinforcement that encourages accountability without pressure

# 4. Culture and Values

The platform is designed to reward commitment over talent, consistency over streaks, improvement over bragging, and respect over ego. Banter is welcome, but abuse, gatekeeping, and nonsense are not tolerated. Serious players at any level should feel at home.

## **Realised by:**

* Clearly stated community principles and behavioural expectations
* Moderation focused on protecting standards and respect
* Recognition systems that reward effort, learning, and consistency
* Role-modelling from respected figures and early members

# 5. How Community Is Embedded

Players train in visible cohorts\*, participate in structured groups, and engage within rating bands. Recognition for effort and improvement is visible and social, reinforcing positive behaviours and sustained participation.

## **Realised by:**

* Training delivered in cohorts rather than isolation
* Structured groups aligned to:
  + Training programmes
  + Rating bands
  + Challenges or competitions
* Social surfacing of milestones such as assessment results and streaks
* Group discussion spaces tied directly to training activity

\* Training cohorts would be a paid tier offering

# 6. Common Training Philosophy

All training and discussion are anchored to a common framework: Overload, Pressure, Progress. This shared language helps players understand why they train specific elements and learn from one another.

## **Realised by:**

* All training plans explicitly mapped to **Overload, Pressure, Progress**
* Consistent language used across:
  + Training descriptions
  + Community discussions
  + Feedback and reflection
* Educational content explaining how the framework applies at different levels
* Assessments and competitions aligned to the same philosophy

# 7. Quantifiable Performance

Every training session contributes data that helps players understand not just how they performed on a given day, but how their game is evolving over time. Performance data is used to reveal trends, validate improvement, and guide future training focus—supporting smarter practice rather than judgement of individual sessions.

## **Realised by:**

* Recording outcomes from every training session using low-friction input methods (e.g. voice capture with manual fallback)
* Capturing performance data aligned to the purpose of each session (e.g. scoring, finishing, pressure execution)
* Aggregating session data into short-, medium-, and long-term performance trends
* Presenting progress visually to highlight improvement, plateaus, and the impact of training focus
* In paid tiers, applying deeper analysis to performance data to:
  + Identify recurring weaknesses or inefficiencies
  + Highlight imbalance between scoring, setup, and finishing
  + Surface pressure-related performance drops
  + Suggest focus areas for subsequent training blocks

# 8. Ratings system

As players, just as we all love to know how we are progressing, we also love to have a way to know where we are compared to others. It shouldn’t (and often doesn’t) matter, but nobody wants to find themselves totally out of their depth when it comes to finding a suitable playing partner. OPP will assess your current performance levels and assign an OPP rating to you. This can be shared with other OPP members.

The handicap-style rating system enables fair competition and meaningful grouping. Ratings are earned only through formal assessment, protecting integrity, trust, and credibility within the community. Your rating will vary (hopefully increasing) through platform engagement.

## **Realised by:**

* Deriving a player’s rating from **recent performance data** on the platform (e.g. a rolling three-month window) to ensure the rating reflects current playing ability rather than historical peak performance
* Basing rating inputs on **structured training sessions and formal assessments**, rather than casual or unstructured play
* Applying **additional weighting to formal events** (e.g. assessment days, controlled competitions), with the option for higher-confidence events to influence ratings more strongly (e.g. “double points” events as a future feature)
* Using a **handicap-style model**, inspired by golf, where:
  + A defined “scratch” benchmark represents elite performance
  + Player ratings express performance **relative to that benchmark**
  + Progress is measured as movement toward scratch rather than chasing absolute scores
* Defining scratch using a grounded reference point, such as long-term elite performance levels associated with **Professional Darts Corporation** conditions, providing an aspirational but credible baseline

# 9. Competition as a Community Event

Competition is designed to bring players together, create shared moments, and test progress rather than define worth. Winning matters, but participation and improvement matter more.

## Realised by:

* Competitions designed around improvement and pressure, not elimination
* Competition performance based around engagement and improvement, not absolute performance. (e.g. 100% streak on training sessions in the month)
* Players grouped together by ability
* Assessment-based events rather than constant ladders
* Shared reflection and discussion after competitions
* Recognition for participation and progress, not only winning
* Prizes to include pro-darts fitting, video coaching, etc..

# 10. Professional Input

Professional standards are a cornerstone of the platform’s credibility. To ensure trust, consistency, and legitimacy within the wider darts community, the platform will be fronted by a recognised and respected figure from the world of darts who acts as the **public face and standard-setter** for OPP.

This role provides immediate credibility and a clear point of reference for players, partners, and the wider community. It reinforces that the platform is grounded in real-world experience rather than theory alone, and that its training philosophy and assessments are aligned with professional expectations of performance and improvement.

## **Realised by:**

* Partnering with a recognised name from the darts world as the public face of the platform
* Leveraging their standing within the darts community to establish trust and legitimacy from day one
* Using professional expertise to:
  + Shape and validate structured training programmes
  + Define coaching principles and progression standards
* Providing ongoing instructional and coaching insight through:
  + Dedicated YouTube content
  + Supporting material across relevant social platforms
* Selective in-person representation at sponsored events, assessments, or community milestones, where appropriate

# 11. Tiered Membership

Tiered membership unlocks deeper participation rather than basic belonging. Lowest tier provides access to the basic training program. Paid tiers provide access to the community and richer features: official ratings, competitions, coaching insight, and advanced AI analysis.

## **Realised by:**

* Open access to core community participation
* Higher tiers unlocking:
  + Official handicap ratings
  + Entry into official competitions
  + Deeper performance analysis using AI
  + Access to professional coaching insight
* Tier progression tied to commitment and engagement, not just payment

# 12. Why This Will Succeed

Darts is inherently social, and players crave identity and belonging. However not all players are able to participate in in-person events, and not all players are looking for direct competition (e.g. via platforms such as Darts Counter). By combining structure with community, OPP creates retention, advocacy, and long-term commitment.

## **Realised by:**

* A strong sense of identity and belonging within the community
* Shared language, standards, and expectations
* Visible progress journeys that inspire others
* A balance of structure, support, and aspiration that encourages long-term commitment

# 12. Getting Started

The platform will launch with a small founding cohort to establish culture and standards, followed by a community-first MVP and creator-led growth. The approach is careful, credible, and designed to scale sustainably.

A potential Go to Market [GTM] strategy could look like this:

### Phase 1 – Founding Cohort

* Small pilot group (e.g. 10 students)
  + Only need basic platform functionality
  + Data analytics can be done manually – to tailor training programs
* Focused duration
  + 30/60 days – Long enough to see progress. Short enough to maintain interest
* Explicit outcomes
  + Initial assessment, structured training, final assessment – i.e. Before/After
* Strong culture setting
  + Big emphasis on community – Pilot FB group
* Clear expectations – This is a pilot program where we kick the tyres on what works

### Phase 2 – Community-First MVP

* Groups before features
  + Identify a wider, but still controlled group (perhaps geographically located)
* Recognition before leaderboards
  + Aim is to champion progress (that’s the key outcome)
  + Potential finals night (in-person)
* Share the journey
  + Socials, YT, etc…
* Launch pre-registration campaign
  + Garners interest
  + Allows us to prepare for full launch

### Phase 3 – Growth Through Belonging

* Word of mouth
* Shared journeys
* Creator-led storytelling
* Member advocacy

# Closing Thought

OPP is not about building the biggest darts app. It is about building a trusted place for players who genuinely want to improve.
